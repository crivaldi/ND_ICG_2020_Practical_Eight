For Practical Eight, you'll do an RNA Seq Analysis similar to the one we did in class with an existing dataset available on Bioconductor - the Airway package. 
The link to the package containing the data can be found here: [Airway](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/data/experiment/html/airway.html)
Optional: Perform an RNA-seq analysis similar to the one we did in class on data from your lab. 
The submission materials are below: 
- A short paragraph describing the dataset (number of samples, condition, etc. - no need for exact sequencing details).
- A table showing the top ten differentially expressed genes in your dataset, including the gene, the log2foldchange, mean count, pval, and adjusted p-value among the columns)
- An MA plot of the dataset
- Any other plot of your choosing that shows something interesting about the data (go wild here - could be heatmap, pathway analysis, choose your own adventure!) 
- Plots should be submitted as separate files (png or jpeg), and have your name in the title of the graph (we didn't go over this in class, but you can find information about adding a title to a graph [here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Titles_(ggplot2)/).
