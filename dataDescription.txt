The data used for this assignment consists of raw gene counts from processed paired-end RNA-seq reads for four Daphnia melanica genotypes (Olympic mountains, WA). There are two tolerant (Y05 and E05) and two not-tolerant (Y023 and R2) Daphnia genotypes to UVR exposure. The data also includes three replicates of UVR (UV) and three replicates of visible light (VIS) treatment for each genotype.
